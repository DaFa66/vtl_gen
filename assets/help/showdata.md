### Showing Data from the Application Tables

This facility is provided so that you can quickly look at existing data in all of the tables that reside in your application's database.

When you click the 'Show' button in the data section you will be shown a dropdown containing all of the tables in the database, simply choose the table whose data you wish to see.  If no data is present you will see an appropriate message to that effect.
